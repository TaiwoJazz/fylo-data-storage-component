## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- TailwindCSS utilities classes
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Being the first time I'm using TailwindCSS, I find it very challenging and I am very glad I was able to complete it after 12 hours of coding... Would probably have spent less time if I were to use vanilla CSS but I'm glad I beginning to get hold of TailwindCSS and its utility classes...



If you want more help with writing markdown, I'd recommend taking [freeCodeCamp Responsive Layout Course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) to learn more.


### Continued development

A firm grip of TailwindCSS...
